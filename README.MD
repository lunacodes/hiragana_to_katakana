# Hiragana to Katana Converter

Chrome extension that automatically converts Hiragana characters to Katakana, to help you learn.

## Installation

This is currently an unpackaged extension. In order to run it, you'll need to do the following:

1. Download the Zip File: <https://github.com/lunacodes/hiragana_to_katakana/archive/refs/heads/main.zip>
2. Unzip the zip file into a convenient folder on your computer
3. Go to chrome://extensions in your browser (Menu -> More tools -> Extensions) and click `Developer Mode`
4. Click `Load Unpacked` and select the `hiragana_to_katakana` folder on your computer

I'll update these instructions once the extension is available on the Chrome Web Store.
